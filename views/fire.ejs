<kbd>Safety Tips and precautions</kbd>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Before Fire:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Clear leaves and other debris from gutters, eaves, porches and decks. This prevents embers from igniting your home.</li>
        <li>Remove dead vegetation and other items from under your deck or porch, and within 10 feet of the house. Learn more about the basics of defensible space on the Firewise website.</li>
        <li>Screen or box-in areas below patios and decks with wire mesh to prevent debris and combustible materials from accumulating.</li>
        <li>Keep your lawn hydrated and maintained. If it is brown, cut it down to reduce fire intensity. Dry grass and shrubs are fuel for wildfire.</li>
