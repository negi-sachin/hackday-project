<kbd>Overview</kbd>
<br>
<p>
        India has a vast coast line which is frequently affected by tropical cyclones causing heavy loss of human lives and property. Cyclones occur usually between April and May (called pre-monsoon cyclonic storms) and between October and December (called post-monsoon cy­clonic storms). While cyclonic storms can’t be prevented, the loss of lives and damage to the properties can be mitigated if prompt action is taken after receiving timely warnings.

<kbd>Safety Tips and precautions</kbd>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Before Cyclone</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Check with your local council or your building control authority to see if your home has been built to cyclone standards.</li>
        <li>Check that the walls, roof and eaves of your home are secure.</li>
        <li>Trim treetops and branches well clear of your home (get council permission).</li>
        <li>Preferably fit shutters, or at least metal screens, to all glass areas.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>During Cyclone</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Re-check your property for any loose material and tie down (or fill with water) all large, relatively light items such as boats and rubbish bins.</li>
        <li>Fill vehicles' fuel tanks. Check your emergency kit and fill water containers.</li>
        <li>Tune to your local radio/TV for further information and warnings.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>When Cyclone strikes</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Disconnect all electrical appliances. Listen to your battery radio for updates.</li>
        <li>Stay inside and shelter {well clear of windows) in the strongest part of the building,
                i.e. cellar, internal hallway or bathroom</li>
        <li>If the building starts to break up, protect yourself with mattresses, rugs or blankets under a
                strong table or bench or hold onto a solid fixture, e.g. a water pipe.</li>   
        <li>Beware the calm 'eye'. If the wind drops, don't assume the cyclone is over; violent winds
                will soon resume from another direction. Wait for the official 'all clear'.</li>             
    </ol>
